# Brand Guide — Cloned

Essence
- Positioning: The local-first agent OS for builders and teams who demand control, security, and extensibility.
- Promise: Power and safety without compromise — your automations, your trust boundaries.
- Tagline: Control, not compromise.

Name
- Product: Cloned
- Suite components: Cloned Core, Cloned Runtime, Cloned Connectors, Cloned UI

Voice
- Confident, precise, transparent. Prefer short, clear sentences. Avoid hype.
- Security-first language. Explain tradeoffs and defaults explicitly.

Design cues
- Palette: deep charcoal, electric blue accents, neutral grays. High-contrast by default.
- Aesthetic: hyperscaler-grade console, strong grid, no clutter, predictable motion.

Principles
- Local-first defaults, cloud-optional extensions
- Signed ecosystems and explicit trust
- Auditable-by-design and redaction everywhere
- Extensible via stable contracts (MCP, schemas, OpenAPI)

Messaging blocks
- Local-first: Run it here. Own the keys.
- Trust model: Signed connectors. Revocation aware.
- Governance: Approvals, budgets, audit. Built-in.
- Velocity: Blueprints and capability graph accelerate setup.

Boilerplate (external)
"Cloned is a local-first agent OS that gives teams secure, signed extensibility and enterprise-grade governance — without surrendering control. Build faster with blueprints, connect safely with verified connectors, and keep every action auditable and under budget."
