# Product Vision and Roadmap (12–18 months)

Vision
- Make Cloned the secure, local-first agent OS that organizations can trust to scale from a single laptop to enterprise workflows — with a thriving signed marketplace.

North Stars
- Security leadership: default-deny egress, pairing, redaction, and signed distribution.
- Extensibility: MCP-first connector ecosystem with stable contracts and versioned schemas.
- Usability: professional Command Center with clear controls and budgets/approvals built-in.
- Portability: local-first with optional managed add-ons that never require giving up keys.

0–3 months (Public v1)
- Core workspace/governance (SQLite/WAL, approvals, audit chain hashes)
- Capability graph + blueprints (researcher/builder/creator)
- Vault integration (Azure KV + dev provider)
- Connector runtime + signing verification (deny-by-default egress)
- GitHub + YouTube connectors
- Command Center UI with pairing and allowed origins
- CI with schema checks, gitleaks, pinning

3–6 months
- Skill packs expansion; more connectors (Slack, web search, docs ingestion)
- Artifact provenance enhancements (OTEL optional, richer manifests)
- Marketplace alpha (publisher verification flow, local install UX polish)
- Enterprise packs: audit export, SSO/SAML, multi-workspace policy management

6–12 months
- Managed add-ons (cloud sync of non-secret metadata; vault helpers)
- Capability/skill marketplace GA with revenue share and verified publishers
- Trust root governance: revocation feeds and alerting
- Increased isolation options (sandboxing profiles per connector)

12–18 months
- Scale-out runners for pipelines
- Deeper domain offerings (e.g., legal research pack with compliant sources)
- Ecosystem certifications (security attestations for official connectors)

Monetization
- Marketplace revenue share (paid connectors/skills)
- Enterprise subscriptions (governance features, support SLAs)
- Managed add-ons (opt-in services that never hold user secrets)

Key bets
- Spec-first stability will grow the ecosystem.
- Signed distribution and clear governance will differentiate on trust.
- Local-first and BYO vault unlock regulated organizations.
