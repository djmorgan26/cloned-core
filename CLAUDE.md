# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

All repository guidelines — project structure, build/test/lint commands, coding conventions, commit standards, security rules, and planning docs — are in **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**.

Read that file first at the start of every session.
